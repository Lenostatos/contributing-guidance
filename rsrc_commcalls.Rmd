## Community Calls {#commcalls}

Our [Community Calls](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/) are an ideal way to “get your toes wet” with rOpenSci. They give you a feeling for how we blend rigorous expertise and recommendations with a friendly and safe way for all participants - presenters and attendees - to stretch themselves. They’re free and open for anyone to attend, and provide an opportunity to connect with rOpenSci community members around the world. Our session on [Maintaining an R package](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2020-03-18/) had 90 participants from 18 countries!

We’ve run more than 25 Community Calls since their start in 2015. Topics range widely and have included [Reproducible research with R](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-07-30/), [Testing](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-12-05/), [Security for R](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-05-07/), [How do you review code that accompanies a research project or paper?](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2018-10-16/), [Involving multilingual communities](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-06-28/), [Research Applications of rOpenSci Taxonomy and Biodiversity Tools](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2019-03-27/), [Governance strategies for open source research software projects](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/2018-12-18/).

> “...there’s nothing like hearing a lively technical banter of experts to pick up the vernacular that one can easily build upon. The first-hand tips and tricks, do’s and don’ts, personal anecdotes of what worked beautifully and what crashed most terribly, offered by years of experience are yet unmatched in bringing newbies into speaking the community’s language.” [Janani Ravi](https://ropensci.org/author/janani-ravi/)

These are not your usual webinar. Some calls might involve two to three speakers on a topic, some give an introduction to our tools in a specific research domain followed by several people presenting their use cases for those tools, and some are a moderated discussion among experts. We always leave at least 20 minutes for Q&A. We use collaborative note-taking allowing participants to share their own ideas or resources and to ask and answer questions. 

> The “... live shared document helps everyone ... formulate what they would like to say and gives people an option to participate without having to ... speak up on the call (reducing the barrier for people, especially newcomers, to asking questions). The document also gives an opportunity for anyone in the community to share their expertise ...” [Janani Ravi](https://ropensci.org/author/janani-ravi/)

Recordings of all past calls are [available online](https://vimeo.com/ropensci), with closed captions for all calls in 2020 or later.
