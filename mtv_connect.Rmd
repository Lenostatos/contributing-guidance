## Connect {#connect}

Stef to write preamble

An implicit value in participating in rOpenSci’s activities is the connections people make with other scientists or research software engineers who want to do their research in a more open fashion. Many people trying to do more open science in their work environments can feel isolated. The rOpenSci community is a welcoming place to connect with like-minded R users and developers who share interests and the related skills, techniques, practices, and values.

All interactions are governed by our [Code of Conduct](#conduct).

**I want to:**

Belong to a community

*   [**Read about our community**](#community)
*   [**Meet the Humans of rOpenSci**](#humans) and learn about their roles, their research, career paths, and contributions
*   [**Read our Code of Conduct**](#conduct) to ensure you’re prepared to participate
*   [**Attend a Community Call**](#commcalls) to get a feel for how we work and communicate with each other. See who else is interested in a topic, what questions they’re asking, ask your own questions in a collegial environment, share your expertise in a collaborative notes resource for the call
*   [**Read blog posts or tech notes**](#blog), particularly those [tagged with “Welcome”](#blog-welcome) to get a feel for how we value people in our community.[**Try a 2-hour remote co-working session**](#channels) with someone in our Slack #co-working channel
*   [**Support fellow community members**](#channels) (e.g., by welcoming newcomers, giving credit, connecting members with people or resources)
*   [**Ask or answer questions**](#channels) in the forum or on Slack

Meet and work with other users and developers of open science packages

*   [**Address an issue**](#issues). Explore open issues in rOpenSci packages and consider submitting a fix. 
*   [**Volunteer to review a package**](#devguide) and use your experience to help a developer
*   [**Volunteer to maintain or co-maintain a package**](#devguide)
*   [**Seek community feedback on your package ideas in the “Packages” category in our forum**](#channels-forum). Ideas for new packages, package updates, or package features.

Gain exposure in the open science R community

*   [**Share a use case**](#usecases) for an rOpenSci package
*   [**Address an issue**](#issues). Explore open issues in rOpenSci packages and consider submitting a fix.
*   [**Volunteer to review a package**](#devguide)
*   [**Submit your package for peer review**](#devguide) if it is in scope for rOpenSci
*   **Propose your idea for a blog post or tech note **(see both the [Blog](#blog) and the [Blog Guide](#blogguide)) to share your experiences

Grow my local or topic-specific community

*   [**Read blog posts or tech notes**](#blog), particularly those tagged with [“Welcome”](#blog-welcome) or [“unconf”](#blog-unconf)
*   Ice breaker (blog)
*   See examples (Australia ozunconf, Antarctic, LatAm rOpenSci community, CDSB Leo’s blog post?) (in community)
