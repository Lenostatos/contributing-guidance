# Welcome! {-}

We’re so happy you found your way here!

The purpose of this guide is to welcome you to rOpenSci and help you recognize yourself as a potential contributor. It will help you figure out what you might gain by giving your time, expertise, and experience, match your needs with things that will help rOpenSci’s mission, and connect you with resources to help you along the way. 

rOpenSci creates technical and community infrastructure for open and reproducible research that lowers barriers to working with scientific data in R. Our staff and community actively foster a welcoming environment where users and developers from different backgrounds and skill levels learn, share ideas and innovate together openly through shared norms and software. Participation in all rOpenSci activities is supported by our [Code of Conduct](#conduct).

We welcome code and non-code contributions from new and seasoned coders at any career stage, and in any sector. You don’t have to be a developer! Maybe you want to spend 30 minutes sharing your package use case in our public forum or reporting a bug, one hour learning by attending a Community Call, five hours reviewing an R package submitted for open peer review, or maybe you want to make an ongoing commitment to help maintain a package.

What are some benefits of contributing?
Connect with a community  who shares your interest in making science more open
Learn from people outside your domain who use R with challenges similar to yours
Ask new research questions by getting to know new software tools and allies
Feel confident and supported in your efforts to write code and develop software
Gain visibility for your open source work
Improve the software you use or built
Level up your R skills
Level up your writing skills
Get more exposure for your package

Read [rOpenSci & Our Community](#intro) for an introduction to our mission, what it means to be part of our community, and to meet some of the [Humans of rOpenSci](#humans).
