## Communication channels {#channels}

The [Humans of rOpenSci](#humans) connect and contribute online across many timezones. 
We carry out our work using multiple channels for one-way and two-way communications that involve different levels of commitment. The following table lists every communication channel and its purpose.

**GitHub** is where the majority of rOpenSci’s work happens. We use our public **discussion forum**, **Twitter**, and **Slack**, each for specific modes of making announcements, promoting contributions from community members, asking and answering questions about rOpenSci packages and recommended best practices, knowledge-sharing and exploration of ideas, as well as more passive learning by "listening" to community wisdom. 

**[Public discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/)** {#channels-forum}

This is where we encourage people to have Q & A on a wide range of topics. The forum is organized in categories including [Use Cases](#usecases) where people post examples of how they’ve used rOpenSci packages, [Blog](#blog) where an entry is made every time a new post or tech note appears on our blog, [Statistical Software Peer Review](#statsreview) for discussion related to our project developing software peer review system for statistical software in R packages, Antarctic for discussions about R in Antarctic and Southern Ocean science. It includes posts like "How do you hire data people in a fair and unbiased way?" in the Community category, to specific help requests about our packages like "Taxize: Get rank of lowest common taxon". 

The benefit of posting to our forum, rather than our semi-closed Slack space or by email, is that questions, answers, use cases and ideas are open for others to benefit, searchable within the forum, and discoverable by browser-based searches. Posting in the forum requires login.

**Slack**

We use Slack as a semi-closed space for communications among people who have made specific contributions to rOpenSci. Read [our definition of community contributions](#community) and become a contributor! The benefit of Slack is the ability to access experts and more experienced folks. People consider it an easier place to ask questions or explore ideas because while it has over 500 members, it’s not fully “in the open”. People join Slack by invitation from rOpenSci staff, a software review editor, or a strategic advisor.
