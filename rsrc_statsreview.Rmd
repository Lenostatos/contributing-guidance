## Statistical Software Peer Review Book {#statsreview}

We invite you to join us in developing standards for peer-reviewed evaluation of statistical software. Browse our free online book [rOpenSci Statistical Software Peer Review](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software-peer-review/index.html). 

rOpenSci runs software peer review for R packages focused on data life cycle management. To apply these processes to software implementing statistical methods and algorithms, we need new ways of evaluating and testing software, and managing the review process. This book serves as a home for collecting research and developing those standards, documenting not only our guidelines for statistical software but also the process of expanding the scope of review so it may be reproduced in other domains.

This work is [supported by the Sloan Foundation](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/07/15/expanding-software-review/) and is organized under an R Consortium Working Group.
