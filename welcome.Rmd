# Welcome! {#welcome}

Welcome. We’re so happy you’re here!

rOpenSci needs contributors and we’d love to help you figure out where you fit. We welcome code and non-code contributions from novices, experts, and the “nexperts” in between, at any career stage in any sector. You don’t have to be a developer! Maybe you want to spend one hour learning by attending a Community Call, or five hours reviewing an R package submitted for open peer review, or maybe you want to make an ongoing commitment to help maintain a package.

rOpenSci creates technical infrastructure for open and reproducible research in the form of carefully vetted, staff- and community-contributed R software tools that lower barriers to working with scientific data. We are changing the game for online coding communities by creating a welcoming environment where you’ll find users and developers from different backgrounds and skill levels, learning, sharing ideas and innovating together.

The **purpose of this guide** is to help you recognize yourself as a potential contributor, help you figure out what you want to get out of giving your time, expertise and experience, match that with some things that will help us in [our mission](https://ropensci.org/about/), and link to the resources that help you get that done.

> Just learned that the webchem package was cited in a paper by a group of oncologists. It totally made my morning to think that my code might someday contribute a teensy tiny bit to better treatments for cancer.  [Eric Scott](https://twitter.com/LeafyEricScott/status/1273605411577442304)
