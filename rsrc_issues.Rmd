## Issues list {#issues}

Here we describe how to find and consider working on open issues in rOpenSci projects. In 2019, 117 people made their first-ever code contribution to rOpenSci! The [rOpenSci issues list](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) is a dynamic page showing all open issues in the “rOpenSci GitHub organization”. 

Issues in GitHub are used to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs. For general information on using issues see the documentation on [Managing your work with issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues), and the GitHub Guide [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Issues can be opened by anyone - the package maintainer, a user reporting a bug or something in the documentation that’s confusing, or a person proposing their idea for contributing. For more sources of information on using GitHub see [Communication channels](#channels-github).

Many of our packages are developed by busy community members working in research environments in which software development is a voluntary, side project. These developers often appreciate help in addressing open issues in their packages. These can involve either code or non-code contributions. Some will be suitable for beginners and some will require more experience. To contribute, see if there is an issue that interests you, take a look at the project’s contributing guide, then comment in the issue to discuss your approach with the maintainer. Once your proposed plan is accepted by the maintainer, create a pull request and submit your solution. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t get an immediate response. It will depend on the popularity of a package and whether maintaining it is part of a person’s “day job”. 

One way to narrow down your search for open issues is to search for labels. 

*   [`help wanted`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) (GitHub search terms `org:ropensci label:"help wanted" state:open`)
*   [`good first issue`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) (GitHub search terms `org:ropensci label:"good first issue" state:open`)
*   [`documentation`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22documentation%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) (GitHub search terms `org:ropensci label:"documentation" state:open`)
*   [`feature`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22feature%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) (GitHub search terms `org:ropensci label:"feature" state:open`)

You can also combine labels in a search.

Are you a package author who wants to encourage people to help with issues in your project? Consider making your packages “[contribution and collaboration friendly](https://devguide.ropensci.org/collaboration.html#friendlyfiles)” by including a [code of conduct](https://devguide.ropensci.org/collaboration.html#code-of-conduct), a contribution guide, and by labelling issues as suggested above. 


### How to contribute? 

*   For package authors: **Label your issues** so people interested in contributing can find them. We recommend “help wanted” (no hyphen), “good first issue”, “beginner”
*   For package authors: **Include future plans for your package** in the README and open issues to address aspects of your plan.
*   **Address a “Help wanted” issue**. Take a look at the [Issues List](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues). If you see one that interests you, take a look at the project’s contributing guide, then comment in the issue to discuss your approach with the author. Create a [pull request](#channels-github) and submit your solution!
*   **Address any open issue.** The majority of [issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) are not labelled “help wanted” but that doesn’t mean the author wouldn’t appreciate your help. Browse the issues in a package you use and see if there’s one you could address. This is a great way to get your favorite packages work the way you want them to!
