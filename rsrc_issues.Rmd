## Issues list {#issues}

The [Issues list](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues) is a dynamic page on GitHub showing all active “Issues” (feature requests, bugs, etc.) in rOpenSci packages that are tagged “help wanted”.

Many of our packages are developed by busy community members working in research environments in which software development is a voluntary, side project. These developers often appreciate help in addressing open issues in their packages. These can involve either code or non-code contributions. Some will be suitable for beginners and some will require more experience. 

To help address an issue see if there is one that interests you, take a look at the project’s contributing guide, then comment in the issue to discuss your approach with the maintainer. Create a pull request and submit your proposed solution!

Package authors who want to encourage community members to help tackle issues should consider making their packages “[contribution and collaboration friendly](https://devguide.ropensci.org/collaboration.html#friendlyfiles)” by including a [code of conduct](https://devguide.ropensci.org/collaboration.html#code-of-conduct), contribution guides, and labelling issues. For general information on using issues to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs, see the GitHub documentation on [Managing your work with issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues), and the GitHub Guide [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).


### How to contribute? 

*   For package authors: **Label your issues** so people interested in contributing can find them. We recommend “help wanted” (no hyphen), “good first issue”, “beginner”
*   For package authors: **Include future plans for your package** in the README and open issues to address aspects of your plan.
*   **Address a “Help wanted” issue**. Take a look at the [Issues List](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aropensci+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues). If you see one that interests you, take a look at the project’s contributing guide, then comment in the issue to discuss your approach with the author. Create a pull request and submit your solution!
*   **Address a general issue.** The majority of issues are not labelled “help wanted” but that doesn’t mean the author wouldn’t appreciate your help. Browse the issues in a package you use and see if there’s one you could address. This is a great way to get your favorite packages work the way you want them to!
